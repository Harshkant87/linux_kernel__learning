------------------- BIOS and UEFI --------------------

1. These are interfaces offered on PC platform to access disk.
2. UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) / EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) were introduced to replace BIOS that has been introduced in 1981 and not seen major changes since.
3. Both BIOS as UEFI were developed to provide a platform that sits between HW Firmware and OS.
4. The most significant advantage of UEFI is its ability to boot from large disks when a GUID Partition Table (GPT) is used.

------------- HOW BOOTLOADER LOADS THE KERNEL ----------

5. The boot loader needs to find kernel and start it with the appropriate parameters.
6. Bootloader needs to read the kernel somewhere from the disk, even if it doesn't have any kernel drivers yet.
7. For this early access, disk FW provides Linear Block Access (LBA), which prvides a slow but uniform method to access disks.
8. Most boot loaders have minimal filesystem knowledge, allowing them to read the kernel file from disk.
